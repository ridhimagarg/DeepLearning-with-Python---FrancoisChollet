### Job of a loss function

    - To control the o/p of NN in order to measure how far it is from actual value

### Job of a optimizer

    - In DL, we used to send a feedback in form of score. We adjust value of weights in a direction in which it will lower the loss score. This adjustment is job of optimizer which is implemented with Backprop.

### SVM in two step

    - Step1: Decision Boundary to Hyperplane.
    - Step2: Maximizing the margin

### Kernel Function

    - It is a tractable function that maps any two input points in a initial space to the distance between two points in your target representation

### Why DL become so famous?

     - Automates crucial steps of ML: feature engineering

### Two essential characteristics of DL
